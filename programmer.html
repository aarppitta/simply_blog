            Becoming a computer programmer involves acquiring the right technical and workplace skills and typically requires earning a bachelor's degree in computer programming or a related field. Some employers require only an associate degree, and it is possible to become a computer programmer without a degree. Computer programmers often take courses and seek certifications to enter the field and stay current in their skills in this ever-evolving profession.

<h3>What is a computer programmer?</h3>

A computer programmer designs and tests computer codes (computer languages) to allow computer applications and software programs to run correctly. Engineers and software developers design the programs and then, programmers typically specialize in using specific codes to translate the designs into a set of instructions that the computer knows how to read. 

People commonly associate computer programming positions with the information technology (IT) industry. Although that association is correct, the need for computer programmers spans across every major industry, including, but not limited to:

Finance: Financial computer programmers may work for lending organizations, banks, credit processing companies, and many other financial industry organizations.

Health care: Computer programmers in the health care industry design and test cloud systems for holding and processing data, analytical solutions, and other types of healthcare-centered software products.

Agriculture: Computer programmers develop machine learning tools and AI applications to find the best way to increase crop yields and field use efficiency while reducing the use of chemicals, waste, and other harmful factors.

Design: Working with and understanding digital materials is easier when a designer has computer programming skills. These skills give them the tools and background needed to carry out design tasks required for their jobs. 

Retail: Traditional retail stores are trying to compete by focusing on increasing online sales. Computer programmers play a crucial role in ensuring retail companies' websites and systems run efficiently for customers and employees.



<h3>Develop the recommended skills </h3>
Both workplace and technical skills are essential to becoming a successful computer programmer. From adaptability and patience to coding and algorithms, this position requires a combination of specific abilities and talents.



<h3>Grow workplace skills</h3>
Communication skills: As a programmer, you will often explain highly technical terms to complete projects and repair issues. The ability to effectively communicate to all types of audiences in different environments is essential for a programmer. 

Problem-solving: One of your primary responsibilities will be to solve problems in this position. Your regular tasks will likely include repairing codes, fixing software issues, and creating technical solutions. Your ability to solve a problem quickly and efficiently will be critical to your professional success.

Adaptability: It is essential to have the ability to handle the changes that come with the computer programming industry, and you should be able to adapt and quickly move forward.

Teamwork: As a computer programmer, you will often work within a team environment. You’ll need to be able to delegate responsibilities or accept a specifically tasked project easily—working as part of a team is a vital skill for a computer programmer.

Patience: Computer programming is a complex process that often takes an extended amount of time to complete. The ability to be patient with your team, your project managers, and yourself is essential.




<h3>Acquire technical skills and common tools
</h3>
Computer programming and coding: Coding is creating a set of instructions that allows a computer to perform a particular task. These are written in specific programming languages, and being well-versed in these is essential to becoming a successful computer programmer.
Data structures and algorithms: These are key parts of programming. Knowing how data is organized and utilized for solving issues will put you ahead of the game as a programmer.

Source control: Understanding how to manage and store code is an essential technical skill of a programmer, meaning you will need to be well-versed in version control concepts and tools.

Understanding common tools: For computer programming, the essential technical skills listed above work hand in hand with common programming tools: 


Source code editing software like Notepad++, Sublime Text, and TextMate

Compiler software, such as MinGW and Borland C++ 

Database management systems software like Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL software, Oracle, and Pick

Development environment software like Microsoft Visual Basic and Xerces2 Java Parser
